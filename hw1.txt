Robert Krawczyk

Chapter 1
1.	Architecture includes: instruction formats, registers
	Organization includes: number of bits per data type, I/O mechanisms

2.	CPU, Main Memory, Input/Output, System Interconnection

3.	CC: System Interconnection
	M: Memory
	I: Input
	O: Output
	R: External Memory


Chapter 2
1. (1):	Superscalar Execution
   (2):	Branch Prediction
   (3):	The computer can get a headstart on fetching the probable next instructions and executing them while waiting for the next step to be decided for sure

2.	Fetch more bits at a time to ensure the CPU is always working at max capacity, this can be applied to fetching from I/O devices or from memory

3.	Inverse

4. (1):	Amdahl's Law
   (2):	100(.40 + .60/10) = 46 seconds

5.	Grocery checkout line

6. (1):	Arithmetic Mean
   (2): Geometric Mean
   (3): No

7.	I included CPU-Z's report of my computer along with this file
